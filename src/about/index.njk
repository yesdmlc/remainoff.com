  <p>
    Remain Off is a personal journal — written slowly, lived quietly. It’s not designed for attention, but for memory. A place to record the small things that often slip past us: the light through a window, the feeling before a departure, the texture of a day that might otherwise be forgotten.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site began as I prepared to leave Vancouver and return to Asia. In the midst of packing, donating, and letting go, I realized how much of life is made up of moments we don’t mean to forget — but do. Not because they’re unimportant, but because memory is porous. We don’t lose these moments. They just get buried.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each entry is a quiet attempt to hold onto something. A photograph, a sentence, a timestamp. Not to preserve it perfectly, but to leave a trace. So that later, when memory stirs, there’s something to return to. A breadcrumb. A signal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remain Off is part documentary, part emotional archive. It’s a way of staying present while moving forward. A way of remaining — even while leaving.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’re welcome to read along. But this is first and foremost for remembering.
