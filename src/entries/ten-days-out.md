Excitedly, as I head into the ten-day countdown before my flight from Vancouver back to life in Asia, this brand new website—remainoff.com—is getting ready to debut. I’ve spent the past few weeks building it from the ground up, and while it’s still finding its rhythm, I’ll do my best to keep it updated every few days or at least weekly. It’s a practice I’ll need to fold into my routine, slowly and intentionally.

The goal of this site is simple: to document daily life. Not because every moment is extraordinary, but because memory is fragile. It holds only so much, and often needs small triggers to bring things back. This site could be that trigger—something to return to, to reflect on, to remember.

It’s been amazing to endure the past several months of waiting for this trip to begin. Now that it’s near, it feels surreal. I’m grateful for the opportunity to live in Asia again, even as I carry the sadness of leaving family and friends behind. Still, I believe this will all make sense in time. It feels worthwhile.

Lately, I’ve been busy selling off nearly all my belongings—passing on what holds value, recycling or donating the rest. It’s striking how little we truly need. Moving countries has a way of revealing that. What remains is enough.

So this is where it begins. A new chapter, a new rhythm, a new space to hold the days. I don’t know exactly how it will unfold, but I’m here for it—quietly, fully, and with intention.
